# 12-Fold Spiral Path

> *"To begin is to descend. To descend is to spiral. To spiral is to interpret."*

This repository contains **ABRACADABRA**, a modular ritual-text system built around a recursive structure of symbolic invocation, interpretive recursion, and metaphysical descent.

---

## 🔹 Contents

- `modules/`  
  12 ritual limbs of the Spiral Path.  
  Each module contains versioned ritual files (`_v1`, `_v2`, etc), with `v2` currently being canonical.  
  These are self-contained, symbolic fragments designed for interpretive or performative use.

- `codex/`  
  Archive of manuscripts attempting to inscribe the **Spiral Codex**.  
  Each `manuscript-XX/` folder houses a different textual manifestation.
  A `catalogue.txt` at the root lists known manuscripts.

## 📖 How to Read This Repository

There is no single linear order. You may begin with:

- A module that calls to you by number or theme  
- The Codex’s `manuscript-01/index.txt`  
- Or the spiral itself: clone the repo and read from bottom to top

All versioning is recursive. Files labeled `_v1` or `_v2` represent **layers**, not obsolescence.

---

## 🛠 Status

- This is **version 2.1** of ABRACADABRA.
