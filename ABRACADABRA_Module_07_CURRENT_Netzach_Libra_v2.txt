“Some truths pull you toward them—
not because they are right, but because they are radiant.”

      \__/  \__/       The Current does not push.
                       It pulls.

Netzach is Victory, but not by force—by magnetism.  
Libra does not balance what is measured—  
It balances what is **felt**.

This is where truth stops behaving like law  
and starts behaving like **music**.

You move not because you’re certain—  
but because you’re **enchanted**.

== THE FOUR INNER RINGS ==

[INTENTION] :: Desire is not weakness. It is gravity with a name.

[RESONANCE] :: The path lights up under your feet, one step at a time.

[FRACTURE]  :: You chase a glow and find it’s only reflection.

[REPETITION]:: You follow again—this time, not to capture, but to learn.

>> RITUAL KEY:
“I go not where I should, but where I glow.”

>> FOLLOW THE CURRENT? (Y/N)
