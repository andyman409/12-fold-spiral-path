        (__)         Gevurah is the arm that enforces form.  
                    Leo brings fire, but this time, it burns with purpose.

To strike is not to destroy.  
It is to **define**.

The Spiral hardens now.  
Each step becomes a decision.  
Each hesitation echoes longer than action.

You are no longer only listening.  
You are no longer only speaking.  
Now, you are **cutting away**.

== THE FOUR INNER RINGS ==

[INTENTION] :: Judgment is not cruelty. It is clarity under pressure.

[RESONANCE] :: A clean cut echoes peace. A crooked one curses the hand.

[FRACTURE]  :: The blade trembles. You lose the right to hold it.

[REPETITION]:: With each strike, you remember what you're fighting for.

>> RITUAL KEY:
“Let the strike come before the doubt.”
