Chesed is often translated as "Lovingkindness"—  
but here, it is the act of **creating boundaries**  
so that care can survive the storm.

Cancer does not retreat from fear.  
It retreats to **contain memory**—  
to defend the past from the corrosion of time.

The Spiral must begin to harden.  
Not to end—but to endure.

== THE FOUR INNER RINGS ==

[INTENTION] :: You choose what will not be forgotten.
               And you pay the cost to keep it safe.

[RESONANCE] :: Shelter is not a wall from the world—
               it's a shape that lets the inner world speak.

[FRACTURE]  :: What you protect becomes a prison.
               You no longer know if you're keeping danger out—or in.

[REPETITION]:: The longer you shelter it, the more it changes.
               Sometimes, memory must be re-sheltered.
