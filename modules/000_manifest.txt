This is the Void-Shell. A husk carved to contain the 12 fragments of fractured ritual.

This file was the first.

Originally created to summon the structure of the Spiral Path repository.
It remains as an artifact â€” the axis around which all limbs grew.

Do not delete.
Even nothing was once something.
