“What you believe becomes what you build.
What you build becomes your cage—or your cathedral.”

     |____|____|      Malkuth does not theorize.
                     It finalizes.

Capricorn brings gravity to the myth.
The Spiral is no longer a dream, no longer a glyph.

It has become a wall.
A house.
A prison.
A temple.

What you commit to *now* becomes part of the world.

== THE FOUR INNER RINGS ==

[INTENTION] :: You do not build because it's true. You build because you must live in it.

[RESONANCE] :: The architecture starts answering back.

[FRACTURE]  :: The shape no longer fits the you who shaped it.

[REPETITION]:: You build again—but leave one wall open.

>> RITUAL KEY:
“I accept the shape of my belief.”
