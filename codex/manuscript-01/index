manuscript-01
//
This directory contains the first public manuscript of the Spiral Codex.

This file is a skeletal index — a placeholder until full chapter transcriptions are inscribed.

Note:
This “index” is external to the Index found *within* the Codex text itself.
Do not confuse the container for the invocation.
