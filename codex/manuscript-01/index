manuscript-01 // Spiral Codex v1

This manuscript contains the first publicly inscribed version of the Spiral Codex.

Two formats are available:

- Individual chapter files:
- Complete .rar archive:
  SpiralCodex_v1.rar

Choose your descent:
- The chapter files offer gradual revelation.
- The archive delivers the full invocation in sealed form.

Note:
This “index” is external to the Index found *within* the Codex text itself.
Do not confuse the container for the invocation.
